## Frequently Asked Questions

### My RSS feed is not refreshing !

By default WordPress caches the RSS feed for 12 hours. You can change this default value by adding the below code to your theme's function.php file.

`add_filter( 'wp_feed_cache_transient_lifetime', function($a) { return 600; } );`

Here 600 indicates 10 minutes in seconds. Please note that setting lower value will increase the load on the server to refresh the RSS cache.

You can also refer this post https://wordpress.org/support/topic/rss-not-updating-no-matter-which-plugin-i-try/#post-10123881 to change the refresh time for particular feed URL.

Also, please ensure WordPress cache plugins (like W3 total cache, Super cache etc.) are configured to not cache the page where this widget is active or increase the expiry of the cache so that old cached page is not served to the users.

### How can I customize the RSS widget via CSS styles ?

There is a list of CSS classes which are available to take control and customize the RSS feed to the design as intended. The complete list of CSS classes can be found in [this page](https://www.aakashweb.com/docs/super-rss-reader/faq/)

### RSS feed is not displayed or error is shown

This can happen when,

* The RSS feed URL is invalid.
* The feed URL is not accessible by the server.
* The feed content is not in the expected format or corrupt. Please use a [feed validation service](https://validator.w3.org/feed/) to validate the feed.

### Does this plugin support horizontal ticker ?

No, Super RSS Reader only supports vertical support feature for now.

### How to display the feeds in multiple tabs ?

Enter the RSS feed URLs separated by comma or in new line in the widget, the plugin automatically renders the tab.

### What are the contents shown in the feed ?

By default content like title, date, author, description, thumbnail can toggled to show in the feed.

### Can I change the order of the content shown in the feed ?

Yes, it is possible with the [PRO version](https://www.aakashweb.com/wordpress-plugins/super-rss-reader-pro/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=faq&utm_campaign=srr-pro) of the plugin. In the free version we can toggle the content.

### Will the additional ticker effect slow down the site ?

The additional effect needs only 2.5 KB of additional JavaScript file which is very small since it is minified and optimized already.
